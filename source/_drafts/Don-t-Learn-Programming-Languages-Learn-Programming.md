At a recent meetup for our local freecodecamp group, I heard a question asked that I've seen before on Reddit and other forums in some form or another. It usually goes something like this: "Should I learn a language that will keep me relevant in the next X years or should I learn one that will help me get a job now?" On the surface, the answer is simply it depends whether you are looking for a job immediately or if you're preparing for the future. But I feel like this question masks a much simpler question that many beginners tend to ask: "What programming language should I learn?"

#### There's so much to choose from
For college freshmen enrolled in Computer Science, they usually don't have to worry about this since they don't get to choose; they use whatever is decided by the professor. But for those looking to learn on their own, it can be easy to get lost in the vast number of languages and the noise of conflicting opinions on the internet. There are many languages that are appropriate as a starter language for reasons ranging from shallow initial learning curve to wide use in the industry, such as Java, C++, Python, Ruby, and many others. However, it seems many learners get caught up in deciding what language to learn that they forget the main purpose of learning programming.

#### Don't dwell on it
Too often do wars rage on the internet about which language to pick. It's fine to pick languages based on what your goal is, but don't waste too much time on it. For example, learning Python for data science, C for embedded systems, or JavaScript for web development. There's a reason that many will suggest that it doesn't really matter which language you pick at the beginning.

Once you've picked a language, stay focused and dive deep into the language, and get to learning the basics of programming. Many concepts carry over between languages such as conditionals, loops, and functions. Thanks to these similarities between languages, once you've gotten familiar with one language it will be very easy to transition to another when the need arises.
