It's that time of year again.

Kids are out shopping in preparation for the new school year after a good long summer break.

Flashy notebooks, the most high-tech calculators, shiny new stationery.

As a college student, I don't need any of that. All I seem to need is a few notebooks from the discount bin at the supermarket, a couple of pen and pencils, and my laptop.

With the new semester coming around the corner, instead of preparing for classes the next day, I'm here starting up this blog. If you happen to come across this blog, I'm sure you're wondering at least two things by now: who are you, and why are you blogging? Good questions.

My name is Christopher Tse, though more often than not I go by Chris. I'm currently in my senior year at the University of Oklahoma finishing up my bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Before settling on this degree I hopped around a bit between Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering before deciding finally on Computer Science. Circuits and electronics engineering aren't really for me, so I went the route where I could work with code more and learn more about programming.
